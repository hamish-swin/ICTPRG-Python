Broadband:
	Multiple transmissions occuring at the same time,
	seperated by frequency / channels.

Baseband:
	Single channel transmission, not seperated by
	frequency or channels.

Unix File Permissions:
	[EG]
	chmod 723 (CHANGE MODE)
	chmod (owner,group,something else)
	
	First digit (7) is the owners permisions (Read,Write,Execute)
	It is expressed as an octal number (7=111), which means full
	read, write, execute permissions (read=1,write=1,ex=1)

	Similary, if the number was 6 (octal 110) it mean that the owner
	would have read and write, but not execute. Big brains.
