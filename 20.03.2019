Networking Associations
 - Internet Engineering Task Force
	People who run & engineer the Internet.

 - Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
	Maintains wireless and ethernet standards.

Network Protocols
 - TCP/IP Model
	Dumbed down version of the OSI model

	# LAYERS #
	7. Application
	6. Application
	5. Application
	4. Transport
	3. Internet
	2. Network Access
	1. Network Access

 - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
	More lightweight than TCP/IP stack.	

	# LAYERS #
	- Upper Layers (All these are network aware)
	7. Application
	6. Presentation (Data Presentation)
		TL:DR How can my date from one system be transferred to another
		PC in a way that it can be used?
	5. Session (Data Communication Session) 
	
	- Lower Layers
	4. Transport (Segments Transport) (Video and voice streaming (Opus Voice, etc))
	3. Network (IP, DNS & Routing)
	2. Data Link (Network Switching, NICs & Drivers)
	1. Physical 


Network Protocols
 - Logical IP Addressing
	The network portion is the left hand portion of the IP address. It's the
	same as everything else on the same network.

	The host portion

 - Subnet Mask
	The subnet mask is applied to the IP address to determine
	whether an address is within the local network o

Network Design
 - Switching Init
	Initially, the switch listens in on all the MAC addresses being sent 
	from the network frames. It then makes switching decisions based on
	these insights. It listens to the source addressess from the frames
	and makes switching decisions.

 - Exhausting MAC address table results in the switch sending packets to every computer
   This MAC address table can be done as an attack as MAC address poisoning, which has
   little practical use, but can used as a good decoy.

 - Layered Design
	Access, Distribution & Core.
	Some networks only have 2 layers, as needed dependent on complexity

	1. Access Layer is your end-user devices such as phones, laptops
	   and PCs. Also contains devices such as switches (Layer 2 switches)

	2. The distribution layer 

 - Routing
	- Routers can route to different networks internally. These routers typically
	  have a really small routing table.
	- I think that switches do some routing for internal networks????
	- Routers are in networks to make brodcasts smaller.
